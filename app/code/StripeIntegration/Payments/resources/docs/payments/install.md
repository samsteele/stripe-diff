{% tabs pref="integration" defaultValue="marketplace" %}

{% tab title="From the Marketplace (recommended)" id="marketplace" %}

1. Place an order for the module through the [Adobe Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/stripe-stripe-payments.html).

1. Open a terminal and run the following command in your Adobe Commerce directory:

    ```bash
    composer require stripe/stripe-payments
    ```

At this stage, you might have to submit your username and password. Provide your [Adobe Commerce authentication keys](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html). You can accept to save your credentials when prompted by Composer. If you've saved your keys and see the error `Invalid Credentials`, update your keys in `~/.composer/auth.json` or delete this file and run the command again.

1. Set up the module by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    php bin/magento setup:upgrade
    php bin/magento cache:flush
    php bin/magento cache:clean
    ```

1. If you run Adobe Commerce in production mode, you must also compile and deploy the module's static files.

```bash
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
```
{% /tab %}

{% tab title="From the raw package" id="package" %}

## Upgrade the module {% #upgrade %}

Before you upgrade:

- Back up your files and database.
- Start with your test environment.
- Keep a copy of any customization you made to the module’s original code.
- Check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-magento2-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Patch releases (x.x.Y) are backward compatible and require no extra development on your side after you upgrade. Minor and major releases might add new features or change code in a backwards incompatible way. If you customized the module’s code, you’ll need to port these customizations after upgrading and resolve any potential conflict.
