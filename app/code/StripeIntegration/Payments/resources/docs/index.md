Stripe provides two different connectors for Adobe Commerce and Magento open source:

* The [payments connector](/connectors/adobe-commerce/payments) can be used to accept payments from a wide selection of payment methods and to automate tax calculation and reporting
* Use the [standalone tax connector](/connectors/adobe-commerce/standalone-tax) to automate tax calculation and reporting if you're not using Stripe to accept payments. We don't recommended it if you're using our payments connector.
